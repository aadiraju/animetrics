# Solo_100 Processed Data
This folder has all the cleaned and processed data obtained after the EDA and analysis.


After running the two Jupyter notebooks in `analysis` from the root, there should be three `.csv` files in this folder, namely:
* `anime.csv` : This csv file stores the processed and cleaned set of anime that has been used for this analysis. Points of note include the `genre_1` and `genre_2` columns, which store the primary and secondary genre of the anime.
* `ratings.csv` : This file stores the processed data including overall user ratings by anime_id
* `usercount.csv` : This file has the details for how many anime a user has seen/rated on the site by their user_id


*All .csv files in this folder are stored with Git LFS.*
